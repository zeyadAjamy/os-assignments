Explanation:
-------------
(+) The sys time increases by increasing the syscalls caused by thread creation and destruction.
(+) the real time tends to decrease as the threads are executing in parallel the real time is decreasing with the number of threads.
(+) The user time tends to increase as it is the total time ouside the kernal within the process 

Comparision with Ex3:
---------------------
(+) the sys time in the 4th is over all greater than the 3rd as the 4th has malloc the counts in the sys time.
