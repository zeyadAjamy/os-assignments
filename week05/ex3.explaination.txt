Explanation:
-------------
(+) The sys time is about zero because the program is not doing alot of  system calls, it is only doing some calculations and creating threads.
    However, it slightly increases when the number of threads increases.
(+) The user time is increasing with the number of threads.  Means outside the kernal mode, thus it is not counting the operation done in the kernal 
    thus it decreasing with the number of threads. and this explain why the slight increase in the sys time.
(+) The real time is the time taken from the start to the end of execution and it remove the time used by other process and it.
    that means as the threads are executing in parallel the real time is decreasing with the number of threads.
