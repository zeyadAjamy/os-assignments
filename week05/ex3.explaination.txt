Explanation:
-------------
(+) The sys time is about zero because the program is not doing alot of system calls, it is only doing some calculations and creating threads.
(+) The real time is increasing with the number of threads because the program is doing more calculations, and the more threads it has,
    the more calculations it has to do. Also, it takes more time to create a thread and destroy it, so the more threads it has, the more time it takes to create and destroy them.
(+) The user time is the time spent in the user mode thus the time spent in the program itself. And we know that the threads execute in parallel, 
    so the real time is decreasing with the number of threads.
